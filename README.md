# play-macwire-starterkit

The [Play](https://www.playframework.com/) framework starterkit with compile time DI using [MacWire](https://github.com/adamw/macwire).

## How to start?

1. Download & install sbt from [http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html). If you already have it, just skip this step and do the followings.
1. Execute following commands.
    ``` shell
    git clone https://github.com/ailrun/play-macwire-starterkit
    cd play-macwire-starterkit
    sbt compile
    sbt run
    ```
1. Open your browser (I prefer Firefox!), go to [localhost:9000](localhost:9000) and see your browser console (Pressing `F12` will works in major browsers).
1. or, go to [localhost:9000/echo](localhost:9000/echo) to see headers what you sent.
